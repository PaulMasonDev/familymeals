This project is a React app that will start as an MVP:
    - Allow meal names to be entered into a list

There will then be various iterated versions:
    So far decided:
        1 (MVP): Allow meal names to be entered into a list
        2: Get suggested ingredients from an API based on the meal name and populate a view with them
        3: Allow user to choose which ingredients - and how many - they want or need
        4: Send a final basket of ingredients to a supermarket to create a basket on their service to allow the user to purchase

There may be smaller iterations that introduce storage and authentication.
